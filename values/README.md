# Go by Example: Values

Go has various value types including strings, integers, floats, booleans, etc. Here are a few basic examples.

Strings, which can be added together with `+`.

Integers and floats.

Booleans, with boolean operators as you'd expect.

```sh
$ go run values.go
golang
1+1 = 2
7.0/3.0 = 2.3333333333333335
false
true
false
```
